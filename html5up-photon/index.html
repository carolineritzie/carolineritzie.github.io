							<h3>You Remind Me of a Summer Night</h3>
							<h4>A poem about the nostalgia of young love</h4>

							<p>You give off warmth like the remnants of the summer sun
							<br>And you are the calming breeze that skims my shoulders</p>
								 
							<p>I hear your voice in the crickets that sing
							<br>And see you in the fireflies illuminating the darkness</p>
								 
							<p>You taste of the smores that linger on your lips
							<br>And smell of the bonfire smoke clinging to your t-shirt</p>
								 
							<p>I remember us staring up at the starry sky
							<br>Trying to figure out which constellations we could see</p>
								 
							<p>I remember jumping in the lake without our clothes on
							<br>And racing on the dirt roads in your old pickup</p>
								 
							<p>You are the living memory of summers I will never forget
							<br>A piece of my childhood my kids will never know</p>

							<h3>I Love You</h3>
							<h4>A free-form poem about finding home</h4>
							<p>I would leave you: the late night calls, the forehead kisses, the warmth of your body cradled around mine, I would leave our car rides with the windows down, singing along to my favorite Taylor Swift songs, lyrics you memorized just for me, I would leave your arms wrapped tightly around me, begging me to stay an extra minute, an hour, or forever, I would leave our arguments, the ones over which movie we should watch, which one of us should say sorry first, which one of us should be the first to leave, I would leave your sweatshirts that smell like cigarette smoke, the taste of tobacco on your tongue, the drunk kisses and playful disses; I would leave you, but I don’t know where I would go if you’re the only home I know.</p>

							<h3>Saving Delilah</h3>
							<h4>A short story about mental health, grief, and healing</h4>
							<p>I feel nothing. The pain writhing in my stomach has faded to numbness as my vision, at first all a blur of dark speckles and dull light, grows darker and darker, until I am in complete blackness. I lose all perception of time; moments could be passing by or eons. I wouldn’t know the difference. I am nothing.
								​</p>
								<p>Then, out of the empty, black landscape, I see a hole, first the size of a grain of rice. Bright, blinding light shines through the small slit. The hole grows and grows, the darkness breaking away like the shell of an egg. An ethereal hand from within the lightness reaches out, grabs my hand, and pulls me through the gaping hole.</p>​
								<p>Once I am able to adjust to the light, my vision comes into focus. White, sparkling walls surround me, reminding me of the way a fresh layer of snow glistens in the early morning sun. Above me, warm light shines down through a glass dome skylight. Each ray that touches my skin fills me with heavenly euphoria. Picture the happiest moment of your life—your first kiss with the love of your life, opening that present you’ve always wanted on Christmas Day: that’s only a small fraction of the elation I feel right now. Ahead of me stands what looks like a judge’s bench, intricately carved from marble with gold trim around its borders. 
								​</p>
								<p>To my side is a man I’ve never seen before. He looks more like an apparition than an actual living being, wearing a vintage powder blue tuxedo. He smiles confidently at me, and I swear his teeth sparkled like they do in the cartoons. His body is translucent, like I could reach right through him and not feel a thing. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Don’t sweat this kid. I’ve been in this business for a long time, saving lost, young souls like yourself,” the man says. 
								​</p>
								<p>“W-where are we?” I ask. My tongue feels odd in my mouth, creating a stutter.
								​</p>
								<p>“The living call it the afterlife.” He offers me another one of those big PR smiles. “Pretty nice, isn’t it?”
								​</p>
								<p>I spin around and see translucent figures start to fill rows upon rows of pews cut from the same veiny marble as the judge’s bench. A long stream of ghost-like people enter from the two back arches on either side of the room. Out of curiosity, I try to see what’s on the other side of the arches, but there’s too many people blocking my view. 
								​</p>
								<p>In front of me, a man enters from the door behind the judge’s bench, bending over slightly to fit through the door frame. He’s a tall, paunchy man with long, white hair and a matching beard. His big, circular-framed glasses remind me of owl eyes, and he is dressed in an all-white suit paired with a shiny, metallic, gold tie. He reminds me of Santa Clause, minus the red hat and reindeer. Santa takes a seat and picks up a gavel that appears out of thin air. It glows with golden light, fitting perfectly in his large hands.
								​</p>
								<p>I look down at my own hands, and I am able to see through them like peering through a light fog. I don’t remember how I got here, I don’t even remember my name, but for some odd reason, I don’t care. I feel so warm, so calm, so at peace. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Here we go, first trial of the day,” Judge Santa grunts. From the wrinkles deeply set into his forehead, I can tell that this is far from the first time he’s said those words. 
								​</p>
								<p>He coughs to clear his throat, and it feels like an earthquake tremor just rattled the building. “We have gathered here today for the trial of…” he bellows, his voice commanding the room to silence. His head tilts down toward his desk, like he is reading something, and his glasses fall to the tip of his bulbous nose. He looks up again, pushes his glasses to the bridge of his nose, and stares straight at me. “The trial of Mr. Samuel Roberts. Due to the decisions he made in his prior life, he will not gain immediate entry into the afterlife. He must earn his spot among us or be sentenced to oblivion for the rest of his existence.”
								​</p>
								<p>My lawyer—as it is quickly becoming apparent that I am on trial for some vague reason—speaks before I can even grasp what is going on. “My client wishes to evoke the thirteenth clause.”
								​</p>
								<p>“The Guardian Amendment.” The judge nods, as if he expected this response. “Mr. Astora, you have a choice. Become a guardian angel or return to your state of incoherence.”
								​</p>
								<p>It takes me a moment to realize that it was my turn to answer him. Oblivion wasn’t painful—it wasn’t anything at all—but it doesn’t even compare to the liquid ecstasy coursing through my veins now. I want to spend my eternity here, in the light; however, I don’t even know what being a guardian angel entails, let alone if I’m capable of the task. 
								A parchment materializes on the table in front of me, accompanied by an ink pen. I scan through the bullet list that explains the rules of guardianship. I don’t even need to read the fine print, however, as my lawyer is already leaning over and whispering all the main points into my ear, talking at the speed of the voiceover in medicine commercials when it details the negative side effects. 
								​</p>
								<p>I will gain all the abilities of an angel: superhuman strength, hearing, and invisibility. I won’t have to deal with basic needs, such as eating, sleeping, or pooping. He stresses the point—repeating it twice—that I cannot expose my identity as a guardian in any way, shape, or form as it will lead to immediate removal from the “realm of the living”, as it’s called. Regardless of the fact that the job sounds pretty badass, it’s my only choice if I want to spend my afterlife here. 
								​</p>
								<p>I reply, “Become a guardian angel.” My voice sounds raspy and puny compared to the judge’s thunderous voice. 
								​</p>
								<p>“So be it.” The man smiles at my answer, as if he’s a proud grandpa. He addresses the rest of the court, saying, “You have all beared witness to this agreement. Once Mr. Roberts signs the Guardian Contract, he will be the sole protector of Ms. Delilah Green. If he succeeds in saving her soul, he will be granted entry to the afterlife. If Ms. Green dies and Mr. Astora fails his duty, his soul will be banned forever.”
								​</p>
								<p>I want to ask so many questions. How am I going to find her? What am I saving her from? But I must sign the contract regardless, or I will never set foot here again. 
								​</p>
								<p>I pick up the shimmery gold pen, and I sign on the line below the statement, saying, “I hereby agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this agreement.” 
								​</p>
								<p>As soon as the ink dries, the room before me begins to blur and swirl like I’m trapped in a washing machine until I am standing outside facing an imposing, colonial-style, brick building surrounded by red and orange leaves floating through the air and landing in piles beneath the array of trees. The walkway in front is packed with young adults in backpacks, chatting in small groups and walking hurriedly. Confused and disoriented, I look around to take in more of my surroundings. I am standing in the middle of the road, the brick school building to my left and a tall bell tower to my right. Above me is a stone archway, engraved with the words, “Bannon University, Est. 1854”.
								​</p>
								<p>I turn to look behind me and come face to face with the front of a black pickup truck. My breath catches in my throat, and I brace myself for contact when the truck runs right through me. 
								​</p>
								<p>I feel nothing but a chilly gust of air, which could have just been the fall weather, not even related to the fact that a truck just plowed straight into me. I look down at my hands again. They are translucent like they were in the courtroom. No one seems to notice that I got run over; the students continue on their way to their classes, their eyes focused ahead of them, and the groups of friends continue talking amongst themselves. I must be invisible to them.
								​</p>
								<p>Scanning through the crowd, I find one student in particular that I am drawn to like a magnetic pull. They walk towards the building’s doorway, hands stuffed in their baggy sweatpants, a black hood attempting to cover their poofy brown curls but failing to do so. I follow my instinct, assuming this is the Delilah Green I am tasked to save.
								I follow her up the stairs and down the corridor to her class. She walks up to the professor, who gives her a pitiful smile and says that she’s glad to see her back and to just take her time on the assignments she missed. Delilah doesn’t say much; she murmurs a thank you and takes a seat in the back of the class by herself. I watch her for the whole class period, trying to figure her out. She slouches in her seat and scribbles in her notebook the entire time while the class has a group discussion. She’s silent, occasionally staring off into space. It’s almost like she’s invisible, too.
								​</p>
								<p>The professor dismisses the class, resulting in a mass exodus through the doors. I want to talk to her, perhaps figure out why Judge Santa paired me with her of all people. Running to the nearest bathroom and hiding in a stall so I don’t violate one of the clauses, I try to become visible. I really could have used a handbook on how to be a guardian angel or something, because I have no clue how to activate my powers. 
								I stare at my hands, still translucent like a phantom. I try to concentrate on them, willing them to become solid. Frustrated, I squeeze my hands into fists until my veins pop from under my skin. Luckily, I seem to have figured it out, as my skin saturates to a golden tan color. On my way out of the bathroom, I can’t help but catch a glimpse of my reflection in the water-stained mirror above the moldy sink. 
								​</p>
								<p>It’s funny. I can’t recall what I looked like in my “prior life”, as the judge called it, but I’m pleased with my appearance now. My jaw and cheekbones look like they have been chiseled by Michelangelo. Even with just a t-shirt on, I can see the defined muscles underneath my clothes. My blond hair curls just below my ears, and my eyes match my lawyer’s powder blue suit. While I don’t know what I looked like before, I can guarantee it wasn’t as perfect as I look now. I had no idea that guardian angels looked like California surfer bros. 
								​</p>
								<p>Afraid of losing track of Delilah, I follow the instinctive pull leading me towards her and see her standing in front of a vending machine alone. She’s digging through her backpack, but increasingly growing frustrated as she can’t find what she’s looking for. I seize the opportunity to start a conversation. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Hey,” I say, trying to sound as smooth and charming as I look. Thankfully, my voice is clear and not raspy like before. “You trying to get a soda?”
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah looks up at me for a moment, then back down inside her backpack. I guess God or whoever controls the afterlife did not bless me with enough charisma. “Fuck,” she mouths under her breath, which wouldn’t have been audible without my acute hearing. “Where is it?”
								​</p>
								<p>“Hey, don’t worry about it. I’ll get you something.” I’ve always wanted to try this: ripping off a vending machine and doing it using super human strength. I rock the vending machine back and forth, shaking it until about five bottles of soda fall into the bottom slot. 
								​</p>
								<p>She looks at me, not like I’m an attractive superhero as I hoped, but like I’m an escapee from a mental institution, then grabs a soda and begrudgingly thanks me before swinging her backpack on again.
								“So, what’s your name?” I ask, trying to get her to stay longer. I smile, hoping to convey that I’m friendly. 
								​</p>
								<p>I don’t expect her reaction. “Look, can you just please fuck off? I’m really not interested in you,” she says aggressively. 
								​</p>
								<p>Oh shit. I fucked up. I didn’t mean to come off like I was trying to flirt with her! I try to fix it by telling her that much, but I only manage to get out, “Oh, no, I wasn’t—”, before she’s gone without another word. This is going to be a lot harder than I thought it would be. 
								​</p>
								<p>I turn invisible again and trail her. Of course I should’ve expected her to react in such a way. She’s a girl and I’m a guy; she’s probably used to getting hit on. She doesn’t know that I’m trying to talk to her to save my own soul. 
								​</p>
								<p>When she opens the door, she flings her backpack carelessly onto the floor and jumps onto the bed, lying face down like she’s exerted the last of her energy. Then, she starts to completely let loose, bawling beyond what’s consolable. The only thing I can think to do is watch, even if it makes me feel guilty for not trying to help her. Her stone, hostile facade has been completely washed away by her tears, revealing the vulnerable woman that she is. 
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah stays in her room for the rest of the day, doing a combination of two activities: sleeping and crying. Instead of going to the dining hall, she heats up a bowl of ramen noodles in the microwave, then goes back to wallowing into her pillow. Her roommate comes and goes, but it seems like Delilah and her aren’t exactly friends, more like co-inhabitants at best. Delilah doesn’t leave the room for the whole next day except to use the bathroom. No doubt she is missing all her classes, and she doesn’t even attempt to do homework.
								​</p>
								<p>Since my only responsibility is to protect her, I stay in the room with her, which quickly grows tedious. To try to find out more about her, I peruse through the corkboard above her bed. There are Polaroid pictures of her with what look to be her parents, her sister, her dog, her girl friends. She’s smiling and giggling in the pictures, a complete one-eighty from her current disposition. One boy in particular is on the wall a ton. I can only assume this is her boyfriend, as they look nothing alike. Maybe her ex-boyfriend, which is why she’s so distraught. 
								​</p>
								<p>One day of voluntary isolation turns into three. She spends her time sleeping or journaling. And, of course—not that I need to mention it—crying. Which, maybe I should be glad that my job has been so easy thus far, but at the same time, I really don’t enjoy babysitting a college girl going through an emotional crisis. 
								​</p>
								<p>On Friday night, we hear an unexpected knock on the door. Unexpected for me, as her roommate is able to buzz herself in, and she usually tries to keep out of the dorm as much as possible—I’ve noticed details like this during my long, boring hours of “protecting” Delilah. With my super hearing, I pick up on the chatter in the hallway: “She’ll come to the door, she has to,” and “I bet she’s still crying over that guy.”
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah, laying face down in her comforter, slides off the bed and opens the door. Before her stands two girls dressed like they are about to go to the club. One wears a black crop top with a matching miniskirt and leather kneehigh boots, the other a form-fitting, purple dress made from velvet. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Hey Deli!” they say almost simultaneously in a very shrill, girlish tone. “Let’s get you out of this room. We have to get to The Rose before the line is too crazy long!”
								​</p>
								<p>The girl in the boots gives Delilah a once-over, clearly displeased with her current appearance. Delilah’s three day old shirt and frizzy curls look out of place next to her friends’ party getups. “Deli…” she says with an exaggerated frown. “I didn’t know you were this bad.”
								​</p>
								<p>“I’m fine, guys, really,” Delilah responds, even though the tone of her voice gives away that she is, in fact, not fine at all. “But, I think I need to sit this one out.”
								​</p>
								<p>“Oh, come on, Delilah. A few drinks in, and you’ll forget all about Sam.”
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah flinches at the mention of his name. Either her friends don’t notice her sudden discomfort, or they do, but they don’t give a shit.
								</p>
									<p>“Either way, you can’t just sit in this room all by yourself on a Friday night all depressed and shit,” her other friend chimes in. 
								​</p>
								<p>Boots starts rummaging through her closet, tossing the most revealing clothes she can find onto her bed. Purple starts sorting through the mess of clothes, mixing and matching pieces together. I feel like I’m watching some Disney Channel movie montage where the popular girls makeover the “ugly” girl into the prom queen. Delilah’s eyes turn glazed over, like she’s disassociating from the moment and submitting to her friends’ wishes. 
								​</p>
								<p>I wait in the hallway—because I’m not a pervert—until they all come out ready. Delilah looks completely transformed. She wears a black leather jacket with what looks like lingerie underneath, paired with ripped jeans and ankle boots. She trails behind her gleeful, laughing friends, looking downright miserable. 
								​</p>
								<p>The Rose, like the girls predicted, is absolutely packed. We all wait in line for what seems like hours until we are finally inside the club. Which, to my dismay, is way worse than the line outside. Maybe I wouldn’t think so if I was drunk, like Purple and Boots, who must have pregamed while in Delilah’s room. Even Delilah seems tipsy, and with the alcohol having kicked in, she’s laughing and chatting animatedly with them. 
								​</p>
								<p>I must have frequented places like The Rose a lot during my lifetime, because the sticky floors, the hot air, the smoke drifting through the crowd, and the loud, booming music all seem familiar but unpleasant. I keep a careful eye on Delilah, who is dragged to the bar by her friends. 
								One shot, two shots, three shots, four shots. 
								​</p>
								<p>I want to stop her, but I imagine her reaction would be hostile if some random man came up to her and told her to stop drinking. I’d most definitely be “told” a few choice words, and in the worst case scenario, bitch-slapped. 
								​</p>
								<p>I quickly lose track of her friends—not that I was really paying attention to what they were up to anyways—who tell her that they are going to the restroom and then disappear for around thirty minutes. 
								Delilah looks terrible, even though she’s the happiest that I’ve seen her yet, but that doesn’t mean much considering the smile on her face is fabricated by drunken euphoria. Instantly, my guard rises when she is approached by a group of guys, and I suddenly wish she would have gone with Purple and Boots to the restroom. They look like the stereotypical frat types, basically carbon copies of the same white guy over and over. They buy her a drink, which I want to reprimand her for accepting, but I do not get involved until one of them deliberately brushes his hand across her thigh.
								​</p>
								<p>This time, when I try to become uninvisible, it feels natural, like how a chameleon changes colors. I watch as my hands turn from misty to full of color and walk over to her. I run through what I am going to say in my head. Should I pretend to be the big brother, her boyfriend, her cousin?
								​</p>
								<p>I decide to just wing it as I approach the group. Mocking my relief, I exclaim, “There you are! I’ve been looking all over for you.” Her doe-eyed, brown eyes look at me curiously, as if trying to place my face. “We were just getting ready to leave,” I say, taking her hand. She instantly recoils, shaking her hand away. 
								​</p>
								<p>One of the Chads steps up into my face. “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who are you?”
								​</p>
								<p>I want to curse him out and tell him to mind his own business, but then Delilah’s eyes widen with recognition. “Oh, I know you! You’re that weird guy that got me a soda from the vending machine!”
								​</p>
								<p>Oh, just great. Since she doesn’t say it in a creeped-out manner, I go along with the association, hoping I can steer her away from here.
								</p>
									<p>“Yeah, your friends told me to come get you.” Which, speaking of, I have no idea if they are still in the club or not.
								​</p>
								<p>This time, she accepts my hand. As I guide her towards the exit, I use my sonic hearing to see if I can pick up on her friends’ distinctly annoying voices, finding nothing. I’m mad for Delilah, who isn’t in the right mind to be upset that they left her here by herself. 
								​</p>
								<p>We almost make it the whole way back without any accidents, me steadying her when I think she might topple over, until three-quarters of the way, she bends over and pukes on someone’s front yard. The acrid, sour smell hits my nostrils, making me want to puke, but I still hold her hair back so it doesn’t get in the way of the vomit. 
								​</p>
								<p>I knock on the door to her room, expecting her roommate to be there to open the door. I hear the shuffling of feet inside until the door creaks open. 
								​</p>
								<p>I don’t know what to expect. Gratefulness, relief? But instead I’m met with her roommate in a thin tank top and pair of polka dot underwear cursing me out. “What the hell is wrong with you? Why would you try to stay the night in a drunk girl’s dorm, you sicko! Her boyfriend just died, and you wanna get in her pants?”
								​</p>
								<p>She grabs Delilah’s hand protectively, pulling her into the room. I try to explain to this girl that I just wanted to get her home safely, but she slams the door in my face, almost crushing my nose. But, instead of being annoyed by her reaction, I feel relieved that at least one person in her life is looking out for her. I curse the heavens for not giving me the body of a girl so that I could be perceived as a friend instead of a guy that only does the right thing in order to hop in some girl’s bed.
								​</p>
								<p>Her boyfriend just died, and you wanna get in her pants?
								​</p>
								<p>Sam was her boyfriend. My name is Sam, at least, that’s what they called me during the trial. I hope this is only a coincidence, but there’s really only one way to find out.
								​</p>
								<p>I take this time until she wakes up to do some research, not only to better help Delilah but to sate my curiosity surrounding my own identity. Turning invisible once again, I sneak back to the classrooms to find a computer lab in which I can do some searching with pretty much the only details I am given: “Sam” and “death”. Which is vague, I know, but it’s all I have to work with.
								​</p>
								<p>I type “sam death news” into the Google search bar and find an article from the university’s own student-led newspaper written two months ago. The title of the article reads “Bannon University Student Samuel Roberts Dies by Suicide”. Not only did I die, but it was by my own hand. Not some careless drunk driver or a terminal illness or something out of my control.
								​</p>
								<p>To help focus my thoughts, I close my eyes. Desperate to find some lost memory that might explain the article, I ransack my brain like one might their house to try to find their car keys, yanking open every drawer, pulling up all the couch cushions, ducking under every piece of furniture. Nothing, nothing, until finally, I find something. 
								A dirty sink, worms of blue Crest toothpaste leftover. Small blue capsules in my palm, at least a dozen but maybe more. The unimaginable pain in my stomach, the last thing I remember before everything faded away. 
								​</p>
								<p>I read through the article, published in late August of this year, which focuses on the issue of rising suicide rates among young adults and teens. In the section specifically pertaining to me, it details how I was an honors student studying biochemical engineering here at Bannon. I had a loving mother and a baby sister named Sofia. In the picture of me in the article, I am posing with a dog, an old, chocolate labrador, apparently named Gilly. I was correct when I guessed my appearance must’ve changed post-death. In this picture, I look like an average guy: unkempt, brown hair, pimples speckling my large, bulbous nose, lanky figure. I was only twenty years old when I died. 
								​</p>
								<p>This truly is torture: to see the terminal effects of my suicide on my loved ones, to see the life I left behind. I hated her ex-boyfriend immediately when Delilah’s friends mentioned that he’s the one who caused this. I hated seeing what he had done to a girl who was once so bright and full of life. I turned her into a zombie, a dead thing like myself. 
								​</p>
								<p>Even though I still can’t remember anything about my past life, other than my last moments in this world, I know that I must have loved Delilah. And her grief expresses that she loved me. I owe this to her, to soothe the pain that I created. To prevent her from causing more pain to others. 
								​</p>
								<p>Renewed with energy, I rush back to Delilah’s dorm and contemplate my next move. I need to just talk to her, to have her discuss her feelings out loud, the thoughts she doesn’t share with anyone else. Maybe the fact that I have helped her twice now will have earned me her favor. 
								The door to her dorm is cracked open, but when I peer through, I only see her roommate typing away at her desk. Using my sonic hearing, I hear the sound of a running faucet down the hall. Drawn to the sound like moth to a flame, I find Delilah in a one-person-only bathroom standing before a sink. She holds a bottle of acetaminophen, looking at herself in the mirror, tears falling down her face, her eyes red and puffy. 
								​</p>
								<p>Oh god. No no no no no. 
								​</p>
								<p>She shakes the bottle, and seven pills fall into her palm. 
								​</p>
								<p>I beg her to stop, to put it back, but she can’t hear me.
								​</p>
								<p>She shakes the bottle again, her breath shaking, and five more join the pile. 
								​</p>
								<p>I wrap my arms around her. I do not care that this means I will fail. I do not give a fuck about what happens to my own soul. This isn’t right. I sob into the crook of her neck. Please don’t do this. Please stop. 
								She lets out a startled breath and drops the contents into the sink. She falls out of my grasp, down to the floor. She buries her head into her knees and sobs and sobs and sobs. And I cry with her. 
								​</p>
								<p>I cry out of relief, because she is safe. I cry out of anger, because I am the one who caused this pain. I cry out of anguish, because I threw away my life with her, and I don’t even know why. 
								</p>
									<p>Today is Sunday. A bright, sunny day, just as Sundays are supposed to be. I “fake” ran into her in the hallway. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Hey, how are you feeling?” I ask her. I feel stupid because she probably doesn’t even remember that I was there with her that night. She probably only remembers me as “weird soda machine guy”.
								​</p>
								<p>“Oh! Yeah, my roommate told me that some guy brought me back to my dorm. I remember; it was you.” There is an awkward silence as she looks down at her feet. “Thank you, by the way.”
								​</p>
								<p>“It was the right thing to do.” I smile. “You know, today’s such a nice day out. Would you like to take a walk with me?”
								​</p>
								<p>She does not quite meet my eyes. “Look, I’m not looking to da—”
								​</p>
								<p>“No, no. I’m just looking for a friend. That’s all, I swear,” I interrupt, worried that she might interpret it as ingenuine. Luckily, this puts her mind at ease, because she gives me the first sober smile I’ve seen from her. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Alright.”
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah grabs an oversized denim jacket from her room, and we head to the large nature preserve right outside her dorm. We follow the cobblestone path through a tunnel of trees, crunching vibrantly-colored red, orange, and brown leaves underneath our sneakers. The sun pours down on us, warming our skin. I feel more alive than I ever have, standing here visible next to her.
								​</p>
								<p>I don’t really know how to open up the conversation. So we start talking about anything but her dead boyfriend. She’s so easy to talk to; I can see how I must have fallen in love with her. We don’t get into the topic of her trauma on this first meeting, of course. But, over a week’s period of time, I can almost visibly see a weight being lifted from her shoulders as her normal slouch straightens. 
								​</p>
								<p>“I’m just down the hall, whenever you need me,” I tell her.
								</p>
									<p>It’s about our seventh walk through this garden, three weeks since she tried to kill herself. When she finally opens up to me, I don’t expect it.
									</p>
										<p>“You have no idea how much you have helped me, Drew,” she says, in the middle of our playful debate whether chocolate or vanilla flavoring is superior to the other.
								​</p>
								<p>I had to create a new identity for myself, in order to not expose who I really am. I chose the name Drew for no real reason other than the fact that I think I look like a Drew. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Hm?” I inquire, seeing this as the opportunity for her to talk about her past. “Helping you with what?”
								​</p>
								<p>She’s quiet for a moment. “It’s just been really hard for me ever since—” She chokes on her next words. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Here,” I guide us towards a bench near the edge of a pond. We watch the ducks, that haven’t traveled south for the winter yet, fly and splash around in the pond in front of us, the other students throwing balls back and forth and swinging in their hammocks tied between the nearby trees. The silence is comfortable for us. I want her to take as much time as she needs.
								​</p>
								<p>“My boyfriend, Sam… he-he passed away. Recently. Like… two months ago? It’s been hard to keep track, really. It feels like yesterday every single day.”
								​</p>
								<p>I just listen, not wanting to push too far, studying her features as she looks off into the distance: the gentle upturn of her freckled nose, the curves of her shiny, glossed lips, the few tendrils of brown hair caught in her long eyelashes. 
								​</p>
								<p>“He was… he was everything to me. I didn’t know he was struggling with his mental health. I had no idea. Looking back, I saw the signs. I saw him pull away from me. From everyone around him. He stopped caring about school. He was like, super smart. He wanted to be an engineer.”
								​</p>
								<p>She is silent for a moment, staring out into the pond. On the opposite side from us, a boy is skipping rocks as his girlfriend sits on a blanket watching him. The boy, from this distance, looks like he could be me, with the same unruly brown hair and gangly body. He picks up a rock, brings his arm back like he’s throwing a frisbee, and swings it forward. One, two, three, four hops before it disappears under the rippled surface. 
								​</p>
								<p>“He broke up with me. He told me that he couldn’t be the boyfriend I deserved. He saw how his distant behavior affected me. He wanted to stop hurting me, I know now. That was… three weeks before he did it? Two?” She drops her head down to her palms and sniffles. “I could’ve done something to help him. I should have helped him. It’s my fau—”
								​</p>
								<p>“No,” I say, instinctively holding her hands. “Those were his actions, Delilah. It’s never been your fault.”
								​</p>
								<p>I brush away a strand of hair stuck to her face from tears. She shudders, and I realize that I’m not Sam, not to her. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have touched you.”
								​</p>
								<p>“It’s okay.”
								​</p>
								<p>We are quiet again. A bird chirps in the trees, singing a tune only it understands. Oh, what I wouldn’t give to be Sam again. To be here with Delilah. To have my life back.
								​</p>
								<p>But I can’t get it back. I made my choice; it doesn’t matter if I regret it now. But there is still a chance to save Delilah from making the same choice. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Have you ever considered professional help?” I ask her. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Well, my mother mentioned it to me, right after it happened. She tried to tell me how much it helped her, but I didn’t want to feel like there was something wrong with me, you know?”
								​</p>
								<p>“There’s nothing wrong with seeking help. Plenty of healthy people do. I think, with the trauma you experienced, I think it could really help you.”
								​</p>
								<p>“You help me,” she says softly, and in that moment, she had my heart in the palms of her hands, melting in her warmth. 
								​</p>
								<p>A beam of light shines down on her face through a break in the clouds, illuminating her eyes to a beautiful hazelnut color. I’ve never noticed before now, never been close enough to see, the golden flakes in her irises, glinting in the sunlight. 
								​</p>
								<p>“I’m just some guy. Imagine what someone with a degree could do.”
								​</p>
								<p>She looks down at her hands, intertwined with one another. “I’ll think about it.”
								</p>
									<p>It’s been a few days since I’ve talked to Delilah. The closer we have gotten over these past six months, the harder it’s been to stay invisible. I just want to be around her, all the time, but it’s not enough to just be around her. I want her to know I’m there. 
								​</p>
								<p>As part of her healing process, Delilah and I went to visit my family over winter break. Of course, she didn’t know that was my family, and they didn’t know I was actually their dead relative, but either way, I felt welcome, between the friendly exchanges and the overall familiarity of my childhood home. The best I can describe it as was feeling of déjà vu: even though I couldn’t remember being there, I still knew exactly which step creaked when you stepped on it, where each hallway led, and I could probably pick out which room was mine, even with all the doors closed.
								</p>
									<p>My mother and Sofia so closely resembled the photograph of the boy in the article. They all shared the same shaped nose and ash brown hair. While at first Sofia hid behind her mother’s leg, wary of strangers, she eventually let me hold her. Her skin smelled like maple syrup, reminiscent of the pancakes she had that morning. I shook my mother’s hand, soft like satin, and got to taste her “famous” recipe for apple pie. I’ll admit, it was a bit dry, but I hardly cared—as for the crisp taste brought back a memory of rolling out dough with her in the kitchen—and I told her I loved it. I was upset to find out that the dog, Gilly, had died earlier in the year of natural causes. I really felt for Sam Roberts, the boy who would have remembered his dog and mourned for his loss.
								​</p>
								<p>Delilah was so sweet with my sister, holding Sofia when she outstretched her arms for her and said “up”, bouncing her up and down in her lap at the kitchen table, singing “Ride Little Horsey”. I could tell Delilah and my mom were close by the way they joked around with each other, and their conversations flowed with ease, despite Delilah being a shy person. 
								​</p>
								<p>In another life, I can imagine the scenario differently: sitting around the kitchen table, my mom admiring the sparkling diamond ring on Delilah’s finger. 
								​</p>
								<p>By the time we hopped in Delilah’s car to head back, I felt a sense of closure, knowing that I got to see them one last time. But, at the same time, it created a sense of longing for that life I left behind.
								</p>
									<p>Delilah has been attending therapy for a few months now. She told me that at first it was hard, like taking a shovel to a covered hole, breaking through the dirt barrier meant to keep the pain buried. But she liked her therapist—her name was Emily, the same name as Delilah’s family cat—so gradually, she let her guard down, just like she did with me. I could tell a visible difference now. Pale and sickly before, the color returned to her skin again. She was eating regular meals. She went to class, finished homework, hung out with some new friends that she met in her creative writing class, and she relied way less on me. I was always there for her when she needed me, but slowly, she was standing on her own again. And I regret admitting it, but it made me sad. It meant that I would leave her soon. 
								​</p>
								<p>If only I knew how soon it would be. 
								​</p>
								<p>I had “bumped into” Delilah in the hallway, and we were just chatting about her favorite movie, The Notebook, and I was teasing her about how cliché it was, until I saw it. 
								​</p>
								<p>A bright white light appeared just behind her shoulder. 
								​</p>
								<p>I thought that I would be happy to see the light. To know that my work here is finished and that Delilah doesn’t need me anymore. But something feels wrong. I can’t leave her now; she is just starting on the path to recovery. What if she relapses in my absence? What if she feels like I’m abandoning her, causing her to have trust issues?
								​</p>
								<p>“Hey… Delilah, I have to tell you something. It’s not really the best time, but it’s urgent.”
								​</p>
								<p>“What’s wrong?” she asks, picking up on my change in mood.
								​</p>
								<p>“I, uh,” I scratch the back of my head. “I’m transferring. To a school out in… California. I leave tomorrow.”
								​</p>
								<p>“How could you wait to tell me that now?” Her voice rises, filled with betrayal and hurt disguised with anger. “You’re leaving me?”
								​</p>
								<p>I don’t know how I expected my eventual departure from Delilah to go, but her anger makes me feel more awful than I imagined. 
								​</p>
								<p>“I’m sorry.” It sounds weak and pitiful, a resignation. 
								​</p>
								<p>The words stab a knife into her stomach. She takes a step back and subconsciously clutches her stomach. “Why? The school year is almost over. Just wait it out, at least. ”
								​</p>
								<p>“There’s been a family emergency, and I have to withdraw immediately,” I lie. I had to say something, but I can tell she doesn’t believe me.
								​</p>
								<p>“What happened?” she asks, her brows furrowing in concern.
								​</p>
								<p>I hate that I’m a terrible liar, so I give in. “I can’t tell you—”
								​</p>
								<p>She scoffs, taking a step back from me. 
								​</p>
								<p>“Deli,” I reach for her hand, and she lets me take it, but she doesn’t meet my eyes and instead stares at our interlocked fingers. “If I could tell you, I would. You’re my best friend, and I’m so grateful to have gotten to know you over these past several months. There won’t be a day that goes by without me thinking about you and wondering how you’re doing.” Great, now I was the one sounding cliché. But every word of it was true. I loved her, more than anything I’ve ever known.
								​</p>
								<p>She meets my gaze, and I see a tear dripping down her cheek. But I know this is the kind of sadness that is only temporary. I know, deep down, she will be okay, because I can already see her growth from the lost, traumatized girl she was months ago. This gives me the courage to wrap her in my arms and prepare to leave her.
								​</p>
								<p>“I’ll miss you more than anything,” she whispers in my ear, her hot breath prickling my skin. I clutch her tighter, my last tether to the living world. 
								</p>
									<p>And then I let go.
